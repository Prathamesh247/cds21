PWA Workshop at Chrome Dev Summit 2021

This is the project we'll be coding during the workshop

This webapp takes the data/activities.json file and render a collection of icons that can trigger different activities using deep links for different native apps, such as messaging, maps, browsers, and more.

->Check or update the list of available types at js/handlers.js. 

->Each activity needs a type, a name and an optional icon. If no icon is provided, a default icon for that type is used. Based on the type, several other values are expected, such as "url" for a link, or "place" for a map. These variables are declared in each time in js/handlers.js.

->Run this app in a web server, don't open it from the filesystem. Use 'npx serve' for a simple web server.

Service Worker - Runs client-side in browser's engine. HTTPS required. Acts as network proxy or local web server in the name of the real server in the background.
